## 🏋🏼‍♂️ LiftOff

## 🌟 Highlights

- Athletes: Log your workouts directly for your coach to see ✍🏼
- Coaches: Manage your entire roster & send out programming, all in one app 📕
- Share lifts, meet powerlifters in the area, and scout out competition 👀


## ℹ️ Overview

The purpose behind this application is to centralize the social and practical aspects of powerlifting. 
Being apart of Northeastern Powerlifting, I've been able to experience a unique position where I'm a builder and a user, as well
as having access to a large pool of potential users. This gave me the inspiration for the idea and made me aware of the demand.

LiftOff allows for coach-athlete relationships, giving coaches access and permissions to an athlete's workout program, allowing for
a seamless experience while managing athletes. Additionally, this gives athletes a better experience, where they can view their program, message their
coach, and log their workouts all in one app.

Lastly, lifters and coaches can highlight their lifts, post their meet recaps, join communities and
climb the leaderboards. Powerlifting climbed in popularity over the last few years due to the rise in sharing on social media and
the infamous 'meet recaps' after a competition. So I made this platform to encourage **all** lifters to show what they are capable of.
